There are several things I wish to get out of this class.  I want to brush up on my C++ skills since I have not used them in a very long time, but I also want to become confident in my ability to program (or have the ability to find the resources to program) any project that may be thrown my way.  C++ does have a few specific hurdles that have given me trouble in the past such as pointers, but with a little bit of classwork, I am hopeful I will be better than my previous top form in programming in this language.
